            <p style="color: blue"> Understanding Nipsey Hussle stuggle,the environment he came up form,things he was
                able to
                accomplish, and how he went about doing the things he did inspires me.
                Before his passing he spoke a lot about "The Marathon", saying basically its not where you start but how
                you finish and that the best things in life
                come in due time. Turning this into a brand and clothing line.
            <P style="color:blue"> The second video speaks positivity, when i neeed it the most.</P>
